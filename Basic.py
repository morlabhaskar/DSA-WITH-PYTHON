# Types of Data Structure :
        # a DS is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

# 1.Primitive DS
# 2.Non-Primitive DS or Abstract DS


# 1.Primitive DS :--
        # the primitive DS are primitive data types:
                # -int
                # -char
                # -float
                # -double
                # -pointer
            # that can hold a single values
# 2.Non-Primitive DS :--
        # the non-primitive DS is divided into two types
                # i) Linear DS
                # ii) Non-Linear DS


# i) Linear DS :--
        # the arrangement of data in a sequential manner
        # =>Arrays           -Ticket Booking System   -LeaderBoard 
        # =>Linked list      -Radio                   -web pages
        # =>Stack            -History                 -emails,call-log      LIFO
        # =>Queues           -sending emails,messeges,                      FIFO

# ii)Non-Linear DS :--
        # When element connected to n elements
            # =>Trees
            # =>Graphs          -sortest path




# Types of Algorithms
    # 1.Simple Recursive Algorithm
    # 2.Divide and Conquer A       ==>Binary Search,Merge Sort,Quick Sort,Median Finding
    # 3.Dynamic Programming A      ==>Longest Common Subsequence,Longest Increasing Subsequence,Longest Common Substring etc..,Bellman-Ford A,Knapsack Problems and more
    # 4.Greedy A                   ==>Pick a Shotest Path,Selection Sort,Topological Sort,Prim's A,Kruskal's A,Coin Change Problems,Fractional Knapsack Problems,Job Scheduling A
    # 5.Brute Force A              ==> check all possibilities,time complexity is more
    # 6.Randomized A               ==>Quick Sort



# Asymptotic Notations:----
        # to find the time and space complexities

        # CASES :---
            # 1.Best Case      -Big-O Notation(O)       ==> to take less time and space complexity
            # 2.Worst Case     -Omega Notation(omega)   ==> to take more time and space complexity
            # 3.Average Case   -Theta Notation(theeta)  ==> to take between the Best & Worst, time and space complexity



# --> Binary Search A
        # finding an element's position in a sorted array
        # it is implemented two ways
                # 1.Itetative Method
                # 2.Recursive Method

# --> Bubble Sort
        # it is a simple A . N no.of elements array each number is compared to next number firt number is less than next number its ok otherwise swap that two numbers.
        # in the bubble sort at each iteration largest number is placed last in the array.
